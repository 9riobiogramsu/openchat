# Crane Song Phoenix II: A Tape Emulation Plug-in for AAX
 
If you are looking for a way to add some analog warmth and saturation to your digital recordings, you might be interested in Crane Song Phoenix II, a tape emulation plug-in for Avid's AAX format. Phoenix II is designed by Dave Hill, a renowned engineer and designer who also created the electronics for the ATR Service's Aria discrete tape recorder. Phoenix II simulates the non-linear characteristics of magnetic tape, as well as the interplay between the tape recorder's electronics and equalization curves.
 
Phoenix II has five different tape modes that you can switch between easily: Luminescent, Iridescent, Radiant, Dark Essence, and Luster. Each mode has a different frequency response and compression curve, giving you a variety of sonic options to suit your material. You can also adjust the brightness of each mode with a switch, choosing between Gold (flat), Sapphire (bright), and Opal (warm). The level control determines how much of the tape effect is applied to the signal, and the input trim and output trim controls allow you to fine-tune the gain staging and avoid clipping.

- **Baby Audio TAIP**: This plug-in uses an AI-based algorithm to capture the sonic qualities of magnetic tape. It has four modes: Vintage, Modern, Clean, and Broken. You can also adjust the amount of hiss, wow and flutter, and crosstalk. TAIP is a simple and affordable way to add some tape character to your tracks[^1^].
- **Waves J37**: This plug-in is modeled after the legendary Abbey Road Studios tape machine that was used on many classic recordings by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and others. It has three tape formulas, three bias settings, and three speeds. You can also control the input level, saturation, wow and flutter, delay, and noise. J37 is a versatile and authentic tape emulation that can add some vintage vibe to your mixes[^1^].
- **Softube Tape**: This plug-in is designed to emulate the sound of three different types of tape machines: Type A (classic Swiss high-end), Type B (British transformer-based), and Type C (Japanese low-noise). It has a simple interface with controls for input level, output level, speed stability, crosstalk, dry/wet mix, and tape type. It also has a built-in high-pass filter and oversampling options to reduce aliasing. Tape is a smooth and musical tape emulation that can enhance any source material[^2^].

Tape emulation plug-ins can be used on individual tracks, buses, or the master channel. They can add warmth, saturation, compression, harmonics, glue, depth, and dimension to your sound. They can also help you achieve a more analog and organic feel in your digital productions. However, they are not a magic bullet that will fix bad recordings or mixes. They are tools that require careful use and experimentation to get the best results.
